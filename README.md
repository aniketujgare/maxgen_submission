## Implementation
The assignment is completed with the following overview:

- **1:** OTP authentication requires the app to be published on the Play Store (new rule). Therefore, I implemented email and password authentication with a verification link sent to the email account for verification.

- **2:** The PDF is locally stored and will open directly once you sign in.

- **3:** Vertical scroll, PDF search, and PDF sharing functionality have been completed.

- **4:** Due to time constraints and the absence of state management being specified in the task, I did not implement any state management in the solution.
